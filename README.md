Project Proposal: Weightlifting Workout Planner & Logging Platform
General Description
The Weightlifting Workout Planner & Logging Platform is a web application designed for people who work out to create, manage, and track their workouts effectively. The platform will allow users to build personalized exercises and workouts and log their progress. Additionally, site administrators will have control over a library of exercises accessible to all users, ensuring a consistent and engaging user experience. Workouts would be logged with the date the user performed it with some sort of calendar view. 

Functionalities
User Functionalities:
•	User Authentication: Log in
•	Custom Exercises: Create an exercise (for themselves), if they aren’t already provided in the “library” itself. 
•	Workout Creation: Combine exercises into personalized workouts.
•	Exercise selection: Some sort of search bar to quickly find exercises while putting together your workout.
•	Workout Logging: Track progress and log completed workouts.
•	CRUD: Being able to create workouts/exercises as already stated, and being able to delete or edit them.

Management Functionalities:
•	Admin Authentication: Log in 
•	Exercise Library Management: Create, modify, or delete exercises in the global library for user access.
This platform would be appealing to both novice and advanced lifters. Upon completion, it will serve as a robust tool for anyone looking to enhance their fitness journey. The goal is for it to be simple and user-friendly.
